# For setting up a local git and remote github repos

## Make a new directory and put your scripts inside
cd /c/Users/yanjuns/Desktop/MATLAB_code_Git
mkdir Git_commands
cd Git_commands/

## Create a new repo on github (https://github.com/new) with a same folder name
https://github.com/yanjuns/Git_commands.git

## Navigate to your local folder, i.e., cd Git_commands/, then enter
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m 'your comment here'
git remote add origin https://github.com/yanjuns/Git_commands.git
git push -u origin master
git status

### note: if you want to remove or change a remote origin, run
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yanjuns/Git_commands.git
or
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yanjuns/Git_commands.git

## For later commits, just navigate to the folder, and type
git status
git add .
git commit -m 'your comment here'
git push -u origin master
git status

# For setting up a new computer and clone existing github repo to local drives

## Download and install git bash on https://git-scm.com/downloads, open Git Bash, type
git --version
git config --global user.name "Yanjun Sun"
git config --global user.email "y****@gmail.com"  ### Note: the actual email address was hided here

## If you want to clone your repo to local machine, make correspoding folders in you local drive.
### I personally like to clone selected repos to local, so I prefer using -pull rather than -clone.
cd /c/Users/yanjuns/Desktop/MATLAB_code_Git
mkdir Git_commands
cd Git_commands/

## navigate to the folder with the same repo name on your computer (cd Git_commands/), then type
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yanjuns/Git_commands.git
git pull origin master

### Note: at certain point, there will be a prompt for you to enter the password of github. 


***************************************************************************************************
# If you login GitHub under a different account and want to get re-authenticate to the original account

## First, verify the remote location is correct by: 
git remote -v

## Second, Delete the cached GitHub creds

GUI way (easiest):
Windows Search → “Credential Manager” → Windows Credentials → under Generic Credentials delete any entries like:
git:https://github.com

## Then, try to push again and it the authentication window will prompt up


***************************************************************************************************
# Some useful commands and good practices

## Use git fetch and git merge:
git fetch downloads the latest changes from the remote repository without merging them into your local branch.
git merge allows you to manually merge the fetched changes into your current branch.
This gives you more control over the merge process and helps you avoid unexpected conflicts.

## git pull does fetch and merge
If you have two computers, you worked on computer A, and pushed to the remote repo. Then you open
computer B, and want to work on the same project. Make sure you git pull the changes first to local.

## git stash

# How to update lab website with Visual Studio and Terminal

## I think it is always good to delete the cached GitHub credentials as I have two different GitHub accounts.
Windows Search → “Credential Manager” → Windows Credentials → under Generic Credentials delete any entries like:
git:https://github.com

## Also, make sure your browsers were logged out of GitHub. 

## Open Visual Studio 2019 -> open folder Lab_website\suny-lab.github.io
If VS does not show anything, go to View -> Solution Explorer
Make any edits you want in Visual Studio

## Open Terminal
Type in: cd D:\Lab_website\suny-lab.github.io\
Then type in: bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

## Open browser
Type in: http://127.0.0.1:4000/
This is to view the change locally

## Use Visual Studio to commit and push to remote repo
